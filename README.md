# 🏗️ Morpho Design Visualizer

**Morpho Design Visualizer** is an interactive **web application** developed for the **School of Architecture and Planning, University at Buffalo**, designed to explore, analyze, and visualize architectural design data.  
It provides dynamic 2D, 3D, and parallel coordinate visualizations of architectural parameters, along with linked image views, sorting, and filtering capabilities.

This project helps researchers, architects, and students visualize parametric design results — such as geometry, truss structures, and spatial configurations — in a unified and interactive environment.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧩 Visualization
- **2D Scatter Plots** – Compare any two parameters with interactive hover details.  
- **3D Scatter Plots** – Visualize complex parameter relationships in three dimensions.  
- **Parallel Coordinates** – Explore multi-dimensional data with a horizontal scroller for better axis readability.  
- **Dynamic Color Mapping** – Color-code data points by any numeric parameter.  
- **Download Plots** – Export high-resolution PNGs of all plots with consistent styling and enlarged font sizes.

### 🖼️ Linked Design Views
- Displays multiple **architectural images** (e.g., front, top, isometric, truss deformation views) for each design entry.  
- Click any point or image to view detailed parameters and all related views.

### 🧠 Smart Data Handling
- Handles datasets with hundreds of parameters and design cases.  
- Provides filtering, sorting, and dynamic captioning options.  
- Supports numeric and categorical attributes.
